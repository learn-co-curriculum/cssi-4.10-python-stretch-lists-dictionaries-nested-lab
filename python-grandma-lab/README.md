##Message to Deaf Grandma
<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/after-school-assets/deaf_grandma.jpg" width="400">

***This is a group/pair lab. Write out pseudo-code first!***

Write a `speak_to_grandma` method that accepts one argument: what you want to say to her. Whatever you say to grandma (whatever
you type in), she should respond with `HUH?!  SPEAK UP, SONNY!`, unless you shout it (type in all capitals). If you shout, she can hear you (or at least she thinks so) and yells back, `NO, NOT SINCE 1938!`.

###BONUS
Too easy? To make your program really believable, have grandma shout a different year each time you run the program; maybe any year at random between 1930 and 1950. (Hint: There is a python method that will generate random numbers.)

###DOUBLE BONUS
Grandma decided she wants to keep talking to you and won't let you leave. Change your program so that it keeps running until you shout BYE. (Hint: You will probably want to use a `while loop` to keep the program running.)

###TRIPLE BONUS
Grandma really doesn't want you to leave! When you shout BYE, she pretends not to hear you. Change your program so that you have to shout BYE three times in a row before the program will end. Make sure to test your program: if you shout BYE three times, but not in a row, you should still be talking to grandma.
