##Itsa Mario*

***This is a group lab, so make sure you are working in a group of 2-4 students***

Toward the beginning of World 1-1 in Nintendoâ€™s Super Mario Brothers, Mario must hop over two "half-pyramids" of blocks as he heads toward a flag pole. Below is a screenshot.

Your mission is to recreate these blocks using python.

### Part I: The Boring Pyramid
Create a program that will print the following pyramid:

```
   #  #
  ##  ##
 ###  ###
####  ####
```

(The height and the width of the half-pyramids pictured above are 4 with a gap of size 2 separating them.)

### Part II: User Specified Height

Add a new feature to your program that asks a user how tall they would like to make the pyramid. This should be a non-negative integer no greater than 23 (this is the tallest that a pyramid can be in Mario land).

### Part III: Chained pyramids

Modify your code to prompt the user for the number of pyramids they want. Using this number, stack the pyramids on top of each other in a chain. This would be an example of a pyramid with height of 4 and chain length of 3:
```
   #  #
  ##  ##
 ###  ###
####  ####
   #  #
  ##  ##
 ###  ###
####  ####
   #  #
  ##  ##
 ###  ###
####  ####
```
### Part IV: Every-Other-Upside-Down Pyramid
Modify your code to make every other pyramid inverted. Example:
```
   #  #
  ##  ##
 ###  ###
####  ####
####  ####
 ###  ###
  ##  ##
   #  #
   #  #
  ##  ##
 ###  ###
####  ####
```

### Part V: Rainbow Magic
Find a  gem that allows you to give your pyramids color. Print out a pyramid that covers the colors of the rainbow.

*Inspiration for this lab comes from one of the labs in Harvard's CS50 class (Intro to Computer Science)

### Optional Practice with Git!
To make things a little more interesting, and give you some practice using Git and Github, you'll be working in a group of 3-4 students.

Chose one representative from your group to fork this lab. Everyone in your group should clone from that fork. You'll be combining all of your code at the end and submitting a group pull request from this fork.

Now break up your team in half. Half of you will work on creating the left side of the pyramid and half of you will work on creating the right side of the pyramid.

Everyone should write their code in the `pyramid.py` file, but each team should create their own git branch to work off of. To share your code you'll need to push up your branch to the shared repository (the one you forked from). Then nominate someone on the team to pull down the code and work together as a team to combine the code for left and right sides. You may want to do some refactoring and you will probably have [merge conflicts](https://help.github.com/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-from-the-command-line/) that you will need to resolve.

Use the `git pull` command to pull down the code from Github. You'll also need to use `git merge` to merge each branch into the master branch and combine your changes.

here is a [cheat sheet](https://gist.github.com/dfenjves/6c3832ae7c9d1cf504f2) if you need some help remembering how to use git commands.
